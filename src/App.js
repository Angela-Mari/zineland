            A Poetry Zine

          <p>
          I created this zine after finding a common theme of a love and hate of technology in several of my poems. This was a great exercise in trying to stick to a motif. I enjoyed refreshing myself on my poetry skills as well as soliciting feedback on Reddit. Zines are about creating community and this zine helped me explore a new community (/OCPoetry).
