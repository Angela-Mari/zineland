# Welcome to Zineland
I am so happy to share the final code for Zineland. This react site, deployed as a subsection of my Wordpress site, is a vibrant one-page subsite with scrolling cards and a neubrutalism-inspired design. ðŸ’›

This project is deployed at https://angelageorge.com/zineland

## UI Mockups
Most of the work here was mocking-up the site in Figma to address responsive design needs. You can find those project files [here](https://www.figma.com/file/MhSYrBWp9FLV3FSZZbhJOh/Zineland-UI-Mockups?type=design&mode=design&t=LQa0nOTqlQxy2hfq-1).

## React 

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). You can figure it out from there.
